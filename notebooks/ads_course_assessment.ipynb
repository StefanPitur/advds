    "Welcome to the course assessment for the Advanced Data Science unit. In this assessment you will build a prediction system for UK house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your prediction system will be based on data from the UK Price Paid data available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads). By combining this data with the UK Office for National Statistics data on the latitude/longitude of postcodes (available [here](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)) you will have a record of house prices and their approximate latitude/longitude. Due to the size of these data you will use a relational database to handle them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions of the house price you will augment your data with information obtained from Open Street Map: an open license source of mapping information. You will use the techniques you have learnt in the course to indentify and incorporate useful features for house price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside your implementation you will provide a short repository overview describing how you have implemented the different parts of the project and where you have placed those parts in your code repository. You will submit your code alongside a version of this notebook that will allow your examiner to understand and reconstruct the thinking behind your analysis. This notebook is structured to help you in creating that description and allow you to understand how we will allocate the marks. You should make use of the Fynesse framework (<https://github.com/lawrennd/fynesse_template>) for structuring your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the notebook you create should *tell a story*, any code that is not critical to that story can safely be placed into the associated analysis library and imported for use (structured as given in the Fynesse template)\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum total mark for this assessment is 20. That mark is split into Three Questions below, each worth 5 marks each. Then a final 5 marks will be given for the quality, structure and reusability of the code and analysis you produce giving 20 marks in total. At the end, we would like to know your experience using LLMs in this assignment.\n",

    "### Important Note:\n",

    "*Some tasks in this assignment require you to develop skills for searching for multiple solutions and trying different things. This environment recreates industrial data science and software engineering problems. There is no one right answer.*\n"

    "Create a database table called `pp_data` containing all the UK Price Paid data from the [gov.uk site](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads). You'll need to prepare a new table to receive the data and upload the UK Price Paid data to your database instance. The total data is over 3 gigabytes in size. We suggest that rather than downloading the full data in CSV format, you use the fact that they have split the data into years and into different parts per year. For example, the first part of the data for 2018 is stored at <http://prod.publicdata.landregistry.gov.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pp-2018-part1.csv>.

    "This table should contain the house price paid and the latitude and longitude of the house. We could create a new data frame that contains all this information. However, the computation of that data frame would take some time because of the size of the two existing tables in the join. Whether this is a good idea or not in a live system will depend on how often these predictions are required. If it's very often, it would be better to store the join as a new table in the database, because the one-off cost for that join is amortised across all the future predictions. If only a few predictions are required (like in our lab class) then doing that join on the fly might be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option A: Think about which columns from each table will be useful to you in making predictions, then write code to efficiently select this information and create a data frame from the two tables for a set of properties. \"Join on the fly\". This option looks easier but the disadvantage is the extra latency it adds as joins are performed every time we need to answer data questions. These latencies are usually not accepted in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option B: Alternatively, you can create a database table called `property_prices` to store the join of the tables you created in the previous tasks. The advantage of this approach is that you will get faster responses because the join is performed once. The disadvantage is that populating the new table can take a long time because you would join two big tables. You need to be more creative with this option. Remember that you can divide your dataset by different criteria (e.g., by year) and that loading data from files is much faster than `INSERT INTO` instructions. Populating the table took from 4 to 6 minutes per year in our tests on a Dell Laptop Intel Core i5 with 16GB of RAM and using the Eduroam network at the Computer Lab. Populating the table by year also gives you control over the upload process. You could write your code in a way you can stop and restart the upload process.

If killing the processes does not work, you should reboot the database in the AWS console. Be careful with other database instances if you need to reboot your database.

Using what you have learned about the `osmx` interface in the lectures, write general code for downloading points of interest and other relevant information that you believe may be useful for predicting house prices. Remembering the perspectives we've taken on *data science as debugging*, the remarks we've made when discussing *the data crisis* of the importance of reusability in data analysis, and the techniques we've explored in the labsessions for visualising features and exploring their correlation use the notebook to document your assessment of the OpenStreetMap data as a potential source of data.\n",

You will provide a function that takes input a latitude and longitude as well as the `property_type` (either type\" of property (either `F` - flat, `S` - semidetached, `D` - detached, `T` - terraced or `O` other). Create this function in the `address.py` file, for example in the form,\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Select a bounding box around the housing location in latitude and longitude.\n",
    "2. Select a data range around the prediction date.\n",
    "3. Use the data ecosystem you have build above to build a training set from the relevant time period and location in the UK. Include appropriate features from OSM to improve the prediction.\n",
    "4. Train a linear model on the data set you have created.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Why is my connection to the AWS server intermittent?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Google Colab, online notebooks may throttle your code or time you out. Local Python code is recommended for tasks for large data management in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do SQL queries take a long time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some queries legitimately take a long time, even when done right. We suggest indexing your tables to speed up queries over your database. You can index tables by different columns depending on the queries you want to perform. For example, indexing the tables by `postcode` could speed up the join in Task D. More information regarding indexing in MariaDB is available [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/getting-started-with-indexes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to consider creating single or multi-column indices on coordinates, or any other properties you use to select data, if that step is taking a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your new queries seem stuck, try running `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST`, and `KILL` any stuck processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why are table populating processes taking so long?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again populating the database can take long. However, be careful if you are indexing the tables. You should populate data before indexing. Insert operations are impacted by indexes as they are updated with each new row inserted into the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some other questions are answered in [this reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/CST_ADS/) or [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfDROyUW8HVs2eyxmJzKrYGRdVyUiVXzPcDfwOO8wX0/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to also ask about anything that comes up."
