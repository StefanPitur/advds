By combining this data with the UK Office for National Statistics data on the latitude/longitude of postcodes (available [here](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)) you will have a record of house prices and their approximate latitude/longitude. Due to the size of these data you will use a relational database to handle them.  \n",

You will submit your code alongside a version of this notebook that will allow your examiner to understand and reconstruct the thinking behind your analysis. This notebook is structured to help you in creating that description and allow you to understand how we will allocate the marks.

        "This table should contain the house price paid and the latitude and longitude of the house. We could create a new data frame that contains all this information. However, the computation of that data frame would take some time because of the size of the two existing tables in the join. Whether this is a good idea or not in a live system will depend on how often these predictions are required. If it's very often, it would be better to store the join as a new table in the database, because the one-off cost for that join is amortised across all the future predictions. If only a few predictions are required (like in our lab class) then doing that join on the fly might be better.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Option A: Think about which columns from each table will be useful to you in making predictions, then write code to efficiently select this information and create a data frame from the two tables for a set of properties. \"Join on the fly\". This option looks easier but the disadvantage is the extra latency it adds as joins are performed every time we need to answer data questions. These latencies are usually not accepted in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Option B: Alternatively, you can create a database table called `property_prices` to store the join of the tables you created in the previous tasks. The advantage of this approach is that you will get faster responses because the join is performed once. The disadvantage is that populating the new table can take a long time because you would join two big tables. You need to be more creative with this option. Remember that you can divide your dataset by different criteria (e.g., by year) and that loading data from files is much faster than `INSERT INTO` instructions. Populating the table took from 4 to 6 minutes per year in our tests on a Dell Laptop Intel Core i5 with 16GB of RAM and using the Eduroam network at the Computer Lab. Populating the table by year also gives you control over the upload process. You could write your code in a way you can stop and restart the upload process.

This distance is computed via haversine distance (no good reason behind this, as a plain euclidian would have worked the same on small distances).

        "- Why do SQL queries take a long time?\n",
        "\n",
        "Some queries legitimately take a long time, even when done right. We suggest indexing your tables to speed up queries over your database. You can index tables by different columns depending on the queries you want to perform. For example, indexing the tables by `postcode` could speed up the join in Task D. More information regarding indexing in MariaDB is available [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/getting-started-with-indexes/).\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also want to consider creating single or multi-column indices on coordinates, or any other properties you use to select data, if that step is taking a long time.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your new queries seem stuck, try running `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST`, and `KILL` any stuck processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why are table populating processes taking so long?\n",
        "\n",
        "Again populating the database can take long. However, be careful if you are indexing the tables. You should populate data before indexing. Insert operations are impacted by indexes as they are updated with each new row inserted into the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Some other questions are answered in [this reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/CST_ADS/) or [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfDROyUW8HVs2eyxmJzKrYGRdVyUiVXzPcDfwOO8wX0/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to also ask about anything that comes up."
